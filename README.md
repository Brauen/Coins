# Coins

Finally Releasing my version of @SolexGames/@GrowlyX's version of coins, includes a CoinShop and a configurable GUI along with a flatfile, and MySQL implementation.

I will not provide any updates on this project. 

If you wish to find the original plugin used please follow this link: https://github.com/SolexGames/mCoins-old

For a more newer version of Coins (not published by me) please follow this link: https://github.com/SolexGames/Coins

All credits go to @GrowlyX and @SolexGames for creating the original plugin. I simply added things that I wanted at the time for my server VeracityMC.
